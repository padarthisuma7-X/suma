# Portfolio - Padarthi Sumadhanu (Full Project)

This repository contains the full static portfolio website exactly as provided.

## Files
- `index.html` - Full HTML file (contains Tailwind CDN, inline styles and scripts from original).
- `styles.css` - Extracted CSS (same rules as inline).
- `main.js` - Extracted JS (same logic as inline).
- `README.md` - This file.

## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. For production, consider using a proper Tailwind build (npm + purge) instead of CDN.

## Notes
- I preserved your original markup and scripts exactly so nothing is missing.
- If you want me to split assets differently or add an MIT license, I can do that too.
